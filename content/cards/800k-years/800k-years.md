This chart shows atmospheric CO2 concentration and temperature over the last 800,000 years. The data was produced using the data from two ice cores, and two different studies. One study measured the CO2 concentration of bubbles trapped in the core. The depth of the bubbles indicated age. The other study used the ratio of oxygen-18 and deuterium to infer temperature.

### CO2 levels were under 380 PPM for 800,000 years

&nbsp;

[They are now over 400PPM and rising](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/)
