Here's a plot of the CL12loc data by itself. The upper and lower bands refer to the upper and lower 2.5% quantiles.

The warmest point on the graph is actually slightly cooler that temperatures today.
The sustained rate of change over the last century is what's important, and this data shows the rise since the 1880s is more significant than the 900s
Paleoclimatology is complicated and has a high degree of uncertainty. This data set relied on 91 proxies - not direct measurements. Temperatures have to be reconstructed from the available data
Note the list of proxy data that was used; everything from tree-ring densities to lake sediments at at locations all across the northern hemisphere.
