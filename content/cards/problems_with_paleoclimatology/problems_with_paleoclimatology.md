description: "Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions."

This graph overlays data from 18 different paleoclimate studies and was included in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report 

And it has served as ammunition to attack climate science on blogs, forums, and political discourse. 

"It was warmer in the past!"

"Paleoclimate data can't be trusted!"

The light blue line is CL12loc. It shows the highest temperatures and variability in that chart. It appears to show that temperatures 1000 years ago were on par with today's temperatures, and that massive temperature swings are relatively common. Let's take a closer look at that study, and its data.
