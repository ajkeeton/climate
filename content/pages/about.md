## Background
In 1880s, multiple weather stations were dispersed across the globe. They recorded regular climate data that we can access today.

Over the years, the number of stations around the world grew, the instruments became more accurate, and the records more robust. Then in the 1970s, we began recording satellite data as well.

Those recordings can be used to look for global climate patterns.

Scientists have also discovered ways to extract climate information from numerous "proxy" data sources, such as ice cores, tree rings, ocean sediments, coral, and even fossilized pollen grains.

By aggregating proxy data from across the world, we can reconstruct ancient climate conditions, spanning 100,000s of years. Additionally, the bubbles in ice cores tell us what was *in* the air.
